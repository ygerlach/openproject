module HasDetailsTable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  class_methods do
    # Declares a detail table for this model.
    # The detail model class is generated automatically — no separate file needed.
    #
    # The block is evaluated in the context of the generated detail class,
    # so you can declare associations, validations, callbacks, etc.
    #
    # The back-reference belongs_to, uniqueness constraint, and attribute
    # delegation are set up automatically.
    #
    # +foreign_key+ defaults to the Rails convention (<model_name>_id).
    # Override for STI or other cases where the FK doesn't match.
    #
    # Example:
    #   has_details_table do
    #     belongs_to :parent, class_name: "Group", optional: true
    #     validates :parent, presence: true, if: -> { parent_id.present? }
    #   end
